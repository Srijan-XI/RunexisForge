# Tails User Guide

## Booting Tails
- Download ISO from https://tails.net/install
- Verify signature
- Flash to USB with Etcher or Tails Installer
- Boot from USB; choose language and keyboard

## Networking
- Tor is mandatory; no direct clearnet
- Configure Tor bridges if your network blocks Tor

## Persistent Storage
- Optional encrypted persistent storage for selected data (KeePassXC database, Wi-Fi, additional packages)
- Create via Applications > Tails > Configure Persistent Storage

## Apps
- Tor Browser for web
- Thunderbird with Tor integration
- OnionShare for file sharing over Tor
- Metadata Cleaner for files

## Updates
- Use Tails Upgrader prompts; reflash USB when major releases arrive

## Safety Tips
- Avoid installing to hard disk; Tails is live-only
- Shutdown to clear memory; amnesic by design
