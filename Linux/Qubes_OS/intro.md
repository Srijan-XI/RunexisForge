Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that isolates applications into Xen-based virtual machines (qubes) for compartmentalization.

## Highlights
- Security by isolation using Xen hypervisor
- Template VMs for minimal disk use and centralized updates
- Disposable VMs for risky tasks
- Split-GPG and split-browser workflows
