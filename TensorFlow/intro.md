# TensorFlow — Introduction

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework used to build and train models (especially neural networks). In Python, it’s commonly used via `tensorflow` and the high-level Keras API.

## Why TensorFlow?

- Widely used ML ecosystem
- High-level APIs (Keras) and low-level control when needed
- Large community and many learning resources

## Learning Path

1. Install TensorFlow (CPU) and verify import.
2. Learn tensors, shapes, and basic ops.
3. Train a simple model with Keras.
4. Learn datasets, evaluation, and saving models.
