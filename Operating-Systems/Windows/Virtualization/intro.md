# Virtualization — Introduction

Virtualization lets you run one or more **virtual machines (VMs)** on your computer. Each VM behaves like a separate computer with its own OS.

## Why virtualization is useful

- Safely test Linux/Windows images without changing your main OS
- Create repeatable dev/test environments
- Learn networking, servers, and OS administration

## Key concepts

- **Hypervisor**: software that runs VMs (VirtualBox, VMware)
- **VM**: a virtual computer
- **ISO**: installation media for an OS
- **Snapshot**: a restore point for a VM
- **Bridged vs NAT networking**: how the VM connects to the network

## Tools covered here

- **VirtualBox**: free, popular for learning
- **VMware**: common in enterprise environments
