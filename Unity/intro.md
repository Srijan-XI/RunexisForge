# Unity — Introduction

## Overview
Unity is a real-time 3D (and 2D) game engine used to build games, simulations, AR/VR experiences, and interactive applications. Most Unity gameplay logic is written in **C#** and attached to GameObjects as scripts.

## Why Unity?
- Great for **2D/3D** projects and fast prototyping
- Huge ecosystem (Asset Store, packages, community)
- Cross-platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, console)
- Strong tooling (Editor, Profiler, Timeline, Shader Graph)

## Core Concepts
- **Scene**: A level or collection of objects
- **GameObject**: Entity in a scene
- **Component**: Behavior/data attached to a GameObject
- **MonoBehaviour**: Base class for most scripts
- **Prefab**: Reusable GameObject template
- **Update loop**: `Update()`, `FixedUpdate()`, `LateUpdate()`

## Typical Use Cases
- Indie games (2D platformers, 3D action)
- AR/VR training apps
- Interactive product demos
