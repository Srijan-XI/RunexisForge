# Ruby on Rails Introduction

## Overview

Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a web application framework built with Ruby. It emphasizes convention over configuration and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, enabling rapid development of database-backed web applications.

## Key Features

- **Convention Over Configuration**: Sensible defaults reduce configuration
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Minimize code repetition
- **MVC Architecture**: Separation of concerns
- **ActiveRecord ORM**: Powerful database abstraction layer
- **Rails Generators**: Quick scaffolding for models, controllers, views
- **Asset Pipeline**: Organize and compress CSS/JavaScript
- **Built-in Testing**: Testing framework included
- **Rake Tasks**: Automate common tasks
- **RESTful Routes**: Convention-based routing

## Core Components

1. **Models**: Represent application data and business logic
2. **Controllers**: Handle requests and orchestrate responses
3. **Views**: Render responses (HTML, JSON, XML)
4. **Routes**: Map URLs to controller actions
5. **Migrations**: Version control for database schema
6. **Gems**: Ruby packages for extending functionality

## Rails Principles

- **Convention**: Follow established patterns and naming
- **Productivity**: Get more done with less code
- **Testing**: Make testing part of the development process
- **Security**: Built-in protections against common vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency

## Common Use Cases

- Content management systems
