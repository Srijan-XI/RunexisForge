# Unreal Engine — Introduction

## Overview
Unreal Engine is a high-performance real-time 3D engine widely used for games, film/virtual production, and interactive visualization. Unreal supports both **C++** and visual scripting via **Blueprints**.

## Why Unreal Engine?
- High-end rendering (Nanite/Lumen in UE5)
- Strong tooling for large projects (Editor, Sequencer, profiling)
- Blueprints for fast iteration + C++ for performance and control

## Core Concepts
- **Project**: Container for content and code
- **Level**: Map/scene
- **Actor**: Base object placed in a level
- **Component**: Adds behavior to Actors
- **Blueprint**: Visual scripting and asset system
- **Pawn / Character**: Player-controlled actors
