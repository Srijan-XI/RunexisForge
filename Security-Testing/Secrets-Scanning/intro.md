# Secrets Scanning — Introduction

Secrets scanning detects hardcoded credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) in code, configs, and history before they leak.

## Why it matters

- Prevents credential leaks that lead to account takeover or data breaches
- Complements runtime secret management (vaults, KMS)

## Where to go next

- User guide: `Secrets-Scanning/user-guide.md`
- Include in pre-commit and CI
