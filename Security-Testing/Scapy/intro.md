# Scapy Introduction

## Overview

Scapy is a powerful Python library for packet manipulation and network probing. It allows you to create, send, and analyze network packets at a granular level, making it essential for network penetration testing, packet crafting, and protocol experimentation.

## Key Features

- **Packet Crafting**: Create custom network packets
- **Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network traffic
- **Packet Modification**: Alter packet headers and payloads
- **Protocol Support**: Support for all major network protocols
- **Interactive Shell**: REPL for real-time packet manipulation
- **Penetration Testing**: Tools for network testing
- **Visualization**: Network diagram generation
- **Custom Protocols**: Create and implement custom protocols

## Core Concepts

1. **Packets**: Units of data sent over network
2. **Layers**: Protocol stack (IP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
3. **Packet Stacking**: Combining multiple layers
4. **Raw Sockets**: Direct access to network interface
5. **Sniffing**: Capturing network traffic

## Common Use Cases

- Network packet analysis
- Protocol development and testing
- Port scanning and network discovery
- Vulnerability exploitation
- Network simulation
- Traffic generation
- Malware analysis
- Network troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Basic networking knowledge
- Understanding of TCP/IP protocols
- Administrator/Root privileges
- Linux or Windows (with Npcap)

## Advantages

- Flexible and powerful
- Pure Python implementation
- Excellent for custom tools
- Low-level control
- Educational value
- Cross-platform support
