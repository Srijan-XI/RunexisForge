# n8n — Introduction

n8n is a workflow automation tool that lets you connect apps and services (email, databases, Slack, GitHub, etc.) and build repeatable automations.

## When to use n8n

- Automate repetitive work (notifications, syncing data, scheduled jobs)
- Build integrations without writing a full backend service
- Prototype workflows quickly, then harden them for production

## Key concepts

- **Workflow**: a set of nodes connected together
- **Node**: an action or trigger (e.g., Webhook, Cron, HTTP Request)
- **Trigger**: starts a workflow (Webhook, Schedule/Cron)
- **Execution**: one run of a workflow
- **Credentials**: stored secrets for connecting services
