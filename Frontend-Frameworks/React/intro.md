# React Introduction

## Overview

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components. Developed by Facebook, it enables developers to create interactive, dynamic web applications with a declarative approach to UI development.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering and updates with React's virtual DOM implementation
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Predictable state management through props and state
- **JSX Syntax**: Write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript
- **Hooks**: Use state and other React features without writing class components
- **Large Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with tools like Redux, React Router, and Next.js

## Core Concepts

1. **Components**: Reusable UI elements (functional or class-based)
2. **Props**: Immutable data passed to components
3. **State**: Mutable data managed within components
4. **Hooks**: Functions like useState, useEffect for state management
5. **Virtual DOM**: React's in-memory representation of the actual DOM
6. **Reconciliation**: React's algorithm for updating the DOM efficiently

## Common Use Cases

- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Real-time applications
- Complex interactive dashboards
- Mobile applications (React Native)

## Prerequisites

- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Understanding of ES6+ syntax
- Familiarity with HTML/CSS

## Getting Started

Install Node.js and npm, then use Create React App or Vite to bootstrap a React project.
