# Angular Introduction

## Overview
Angular is a full-featured, opinionated framework for building scalable, enterprise-grade single-page applications (SPAs). Developed and maintained by Google, it provides a complete solution for web development with TypeScript at its core.

## Key Features
- **TypeScript First**: Built with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Component-Based**: Modular architecture with reusable components
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in DI container for managing dependencies
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS for handling asynchronous operations
- **Angular CLI**: Powerful command-line tool for scaffolding and building
- **Testing Framework**: Integrated testing with Jasmine and Karma
- **Routing**: Advanced routing with lazy loading and guards
- **Forms**: Powerful form handling (Template-driven and Reactive)

## Core Concepts
1. **Components**: Building blocks of Angular applications
2. **Services**: Reusable business logic
3. **Modules**: Organize related components, services, and directives
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML functionality
5. **Pipes**: Transform data in templates
6. **RxJS Observables**: Handle asynchronous data streams
7. **Dependency Injection**: Manage component dependencies

## Angular Architecture
- **Smart Components**: Container components managing state
- **Presentational Components**: Dumb components for display
- **Services**: Handle business logic and data
- **Models/Interfaces**: Define data structures
- **Decorators**: Add metadata to classes

## Common Use Cases
- Enterprise-level SPAs
- Complex web applications
- Real-time collaborative applications
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Mobile applications (NativeScript, Ionic)

## Prerequisites
- Solid JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- Understanding of OOP concepts
- Familiarity with RxJS/Observables

## Why Angular?
- Comprehensive framework (no need for external solutions)
- Strong community and corporate backing
- Excellent for large-scale projects
- Built-in testing tools
- Powerful CLI tooling
