# LangChain — Introduction

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for building applications with language models (LLMs). It helps you compose prompts, tools, retrieval (RAG), and chains/agents.

## Important note

Most LangChain apps depend on an external model provider (and API keys). This repo includes starter examples with placeholders so you can wire in your own provider.

## Common use cases

- Chatbots and assistants
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Document summarization pipelines
- Tool-using agents

## Learning Path

1. Learn prompt templates.
2. Learn chaining and simple pipelines.
3. Learn retrieval (vector stores) if needed.
4. Add tools/agents carefully and evaluate outputs.
