# Assembly Introduction

## Overview
Assembly language provides low-level, architecture-specific instructions that map closely to machine code, offering fine-grained control over hardware.

## Key Points
- Each CPU family (x86, x86-64, ARM) has its own syntax and instructions
- Two common syntaxes on x86: Intel and AT&T
- Used for performance-critical code, firmware, and reverse engineering
- Requires understanding of registers, memory addressing, and calling conventions

## Common Use Cases
- Embedded systems and bootloaders
- OS kernels and drivers
- Optimizing hotspots in native code
- Security research and exploit development

## Resources
- x86-64: Intel/AMD manuals
- ARM: ARM Architecture Reference Manual
- Guides: https://wiki.osdev.org and https://godbolt.org for assembly output
