# MATLAB Introduction

## Overview
MATLAB is a high-level language and environment for numerical computing, data analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features
- Built-in matrix-first syntax
- Rich toolboxes for signal, control, image, and ML
- Integrated plotting and apps
- Simulink for model-based design
- Interoperability with Python, C/C++, and Java

## Common Use Cases
- Prototyping algorithms
- Scientific computing and simulations
- Data visualization and reports
- Control systems and DSP

## Essentials
- Scripts use `.m` files; functions defined with `function` keyword
- Package management via Add-On Explorer and `matlab.addons.toolbox`
- Supports live scripts for rich, documented workflows
