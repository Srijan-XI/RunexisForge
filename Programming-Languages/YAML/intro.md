# YAML — Introduction

## What is YAML?

**YAML** (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files. You’ll see it in Kubernetes manifests, CI pipelines (GitHub Actions), Docker Compose, Ansible playbooks, and more.

## Why YAML?

- Easy to read and write
- Great for configuration and infrastructure definitions
- Supports maps, lists, strings, numbers, booleans

## Key rules

- Indentation matters (use spaces, not tabs)
- `-` denotes list items
- `key: value` denotes mappings
- Quotes are optional but sometimes safer

## Learning Path

1. Learn basic mappings/lists.
2. Learn multiline strings.
3. Learn anchors/aliases (optional).
4. Practice validating YAML with a linter.
